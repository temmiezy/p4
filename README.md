## Planner
#### Planner is a planning app built with Laravel with features such as 
- Plan Creation Update and Completion, 
- 7-day plan check, 
- Plan History, 
- Email Registration, 
- Authentication 
- It was built with custom html with bootstrap 4
- The dashboard shows the summary of completed and yet to be completed plans
- Plans whose completion time has passed is not flagged
- Registered users will only see the plan thet create

## Database Summary
- Planner has 2 tables in total (users, plans)
- There is a one-to-many relationship between plans and users

## Notes for Instructor
Every function listed above works but i wish i had more time to add more features such as User Management, and checks for existing plans
